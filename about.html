            <h1>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Hey there! I'm Quartzi,</h3>
    
            <p>A seasoned game developer and software engineer with a passion for crafting immersive digital experiences. Over the years, I've honed my skills in game development and software engineering, specializing in languages like C#, Java and Lua.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My journey began at the age of 5 when I first dabbled in programming, and since then, I've been on a relentless pursuit of knowledge and mastery. While Unity has been my go-to game engine, my expertise extends to a diverse range of languages, including C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, LUA, TypeScript, PHP, C++.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am not just a code enthusiast, I've left my mark in the gaming world with creations like World of Warcraft addons, Minecraft plugins and Terraria Mods and even making Discord Bots, as it is always fun to learn something new and adapt to new challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But it's not just about personal projectsâ€”I'm also passionate about giving back to the community. I actively contribute to open-source development on GitHub, creating tools that empower fellow developers in their game and software development journeys. I believe in making the process easier for everyone, fostering collaboration and innovation within the community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I'm on a mission to turn my passion into a full-time profession, aspiring to make waves in the game development industry and share my journey on platforms like Twitch. If you're as excited about this adventure as I am, check out my Twitch channel and explore the games I've crafted. Feel free to connect with me on various platforms!</p>
