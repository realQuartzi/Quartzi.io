            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>This is no advert for myself to get hired or anything. This is mainly for people to get to know me a bit more then what they see in videos or on twitch.</p>

            <p>Hello, I am mainly known as <b>Quartzi</b>. ^^</p>
            <p>I was first introduced to programming at the age of 5 as well as the MMORPG genre and since then I have a very great liking to MMORPGs as well as programming. 
                Ever since I have been very intouch with video games and started learning to write in javascript. This gaming obsession lasted untill 2012 when I discovered the Unity game engine and have ever since used it. 
                This experience with Unity for such a long time has made me very prominent with Javascript and C#. (Mainly C# ... they kinda stopped using JavaScript... it was a good choice)</p>

            <p> Now to get the professionalism out of the way. Ever since using Unity I have been learning many more languages and these include: C#, JavaScript, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, LUA, TypeScript, PHP, C, C++ and Swift. That is quite a lot. But I ain't no expert!</p>

            <p>I am a fast learner and a fun example of showcasing my ability to learn fast is that I learned how to read LUA syntax in less then 10 minutes so I could make World of Warcraft Addons. That on its own doesnt show experience, but its rather that the API available when Classic WoW got released was basically none existent and it was amazing when I was able to change: My own name, everyone elses name, their description and their guild tag, in less than 2 hours.</p>
            <p>Another fun fact is, that I wrote minecraft plugins because none of the servers that I played on or found ever had systems I personally wanted... So I made an amazing RPG plugin where you would have to level your character and professions to be able to: Wear better gear, Craft Better Items, Break Specific blocks, etc. But then I also made a PvP plugin that added unique classes with a leveling system and custom item system. That was fun ^^</p>

            <p>I quit my last job with the hopes to be able to make a fulltime living through Game Development and a social medium such as Twitch. So if you want to support me with my quest to stay above water! Go check out my twitch and games ^^</p>

            <p>You can contact me through various platforms / sources. Please don't just spam. Thanks</p>
