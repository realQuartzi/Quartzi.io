                    <h2>New peep, who dis?</h1>
                    <p>Hey, I am Quartzi, a game developer, software engineer, full-stack creator, and delusional for believing these "titles" mean anything.</p>
                    <p>My journey began many Warcraft raids ago, tinkering with code, and it hasn’t stopped since. I explore everything from game mechanics to software architecture, always chasing the next challenge. The current one being a solo MMORPG developer. ^^</p>
                    <h2>What does this peep do?</h2>
                    <p>My work spans across various technologies, including:</p>
                    <p><b>Game Development:</b> Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc. and modding for games like <i>World of Warcraft</i>, <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Terraria</i> and anything I can get my fingers around.</p>
                    <p><b>Software Engineering:</b> Full-stack development with C#, Javascript, Typescript, Python, C++, and more.</p>
                    <p><b>Creative Exploration:</b> Writing, music, and open-source contributions that support fellow developers.</p>

                    <p>This website isn’t a portfolio in the traditional sense... it’s a growing archive of my thoughts, projects, and experiments. I build because I love to create, not because I need to sell.</p>
                    <h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>
                    <p>I’m here to share, document, and connect. Whether it’s through coding, streaming, writing, or experimenting with new ideas, this space is a reflection of many things I’ve worked on.</p>
                    <p>If you’re curious, feel free to explore. No expectations... just creativity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>( No I am not changing the font... I like it... just get over it <3 )</p>
