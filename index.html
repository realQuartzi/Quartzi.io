                        I’m a game developer who loves building things that feel good to play. 
                        Most of what I do happens in Unity with C#, where I focus on the flow, 
                        systems, and little details that make gameplay click.
                    </p>

                        I’m still learning the art side, but coding is where I really come alive.
                        I love turning ideas into something real and fun to mess with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coding is my way of learning, experimenting, making cool stuff and my source of happiness and comfort.
