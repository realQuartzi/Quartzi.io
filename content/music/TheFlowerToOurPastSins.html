                    <h2>Verse 1 (Peep 1)</h2>
                    <p>We planted seeds, but they grew into weeds,</p>
                    <p>Dreams we watered got tangled in greed.</p>
                    <p>Every word was a dagger, sharp like a thorn,</p>
                    <p>Our garden of love left broken and worn.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I see your shadow in the petals that fall,</p>
                    <p>Echoes of laughter still haunt these walls.</p>
                    <p>If I could rewind, just a moment in time,</p>
                    <p>I'd prune out the poison, and let love shine.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus (Both)</h2>
                    <p>A flower to our past sins, blooming in the pain,</p>
                    <p>Colors of regret dance in the rain.</p>
                    <p>If only we could start again, begin,</p>
                    <p>Would love still thrive, or wilt in the wind?</p>

                    <h2>Verse 2 (Peep 2)</h2>
                    <p>We were flames too wild, burning the air,</p>
                    <p>Too blind to see the love we shared.</p>
                    <p>You said you'd stay, but I pushed you away,</p>
                    <p>Now I’m lost in the words I didn’t say.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each petal I hold feels heavy with guilt,</p>
                    <p>A garden of sorrow from the walls we built.</p>
                    <p>If I could whisper through the cracks of time,</p>
                    <p>I’d pull back the thorns and call you mine.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus (Both)</h2>
                    <p>A flower to our past sins, blooming in the pain,</p>
                    <p>Colors of regret dance in the rain.</p>
                    <p>If only we could start again, begin,</p>
                    <p>Would love still thrive, or wilt in the wind?</p>

                    <h2>Verse 3 (Both)</h2>
                    <p>Now we’re apart, but the seasons still turn,</p>
                    <p>The lessons of love are the ones that burn.</p>
                    <p>I hold this rose, it’s a symbol of hope,</p>
                    <p>That our hearts might heal, find ways to cope.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But even if time won’t give us a shot,</p>
                    <p>The bloom of regret is all that we’ve got.</p>
                    <p>A token of sorrow, a piece of our truth,</p>
                    <p>A flower to sins, and the love of our youth.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus (Both)</h2>
                    <p>A flower to our past sins, blooming in the pain,</p>
                    <p>Colors of regret dance in the rain.</p>
                    <p>If only we could start again, begin,</p>
                    <p>Would love still thrive, or wilt in the wind?</p>

                    <h2>Outro (Both)</h2>
                    <p>So I’ll lay this rose where our memories lie,</p>
                    <p>A silent goodbye, with a tear in my eye.</p>
                    <p>Our love was a garden, wild and free,</p>
                    <p>But sometimes beauty is born of tragedy.</p>
