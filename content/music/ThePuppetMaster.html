                    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                    <p>Black heels, </p>
                    <p>Big deal, </p>
                    <p>Spinning in a tight reel.</p>
                    <p>Sharp grin, </p>
                    <p>Pulls me in, </p>
                    <p>She always knows how to win.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Red lips, </p>
                    <p>Ice kiss, </p>
                    <p>Leaving trails I can’t dismiss.</p>
                    <p>Wide eyes, </p>
                    <p>Alibis, </p>
                    <p>Playing games I didn’t realize.</p>

                    <h2>Pre Chorus</h2>
                    <p>She says, "Take my hand, baby, follow my lead",</p>
                    <p>But every step she takes leaves me weak at the knees.</p>
                    <p>She’s a venom in silk, a fire that burns,</p>
                    <p>Every twist of her smile, another lesson I’ve learned.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus</h2>
                    <p>Oh, how she moves, how she plays,</p>
                    <p>Turning my nights into poisonous days.</p>
                    <p>Her smile’s a dagger, her touch is a chain,</p>
                    <p>I’m caught in her fire, addicted to the pain.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And when she laughs, it’s the sound of defeat,</p>
                    <p>Every victory she claims tastes bitter and sweet.</p>
                    <p>I’m breaking, I’m shaking, but she holds the key,</p>
                    <p>The only escape is when she sets me free.</p>

                    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                    <p>Dark eyes,</p>
                    <p>Disguise,</p>
                    <p>Pulling strings in plain sight.</p>
                    <p>Soft lies,</p>
                    <p>Sharp bite,</p>
                    <p>Breaking me in every fight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>She leans,</p>
                    <p>She preens,</p>
                    <p>Paints the world like it’s a scene.</p>
                    <p>No shame,</p>
                    <p>Deadly game,</p>
                    <p>But I still play it all the same.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus</h2>
                    <p>Oh, how she moves, how she plays,</p>
                    <p>Turning my nights into poisonous days.</p>
                    <p>Her smile’s a dagger, her touch is a chain,</p>
                    <p>I’m caught in her fire, addicted to the pain.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And when she laughs, it’s the sound of defeat,</p>
                    <p>Every victory she claims tastes bitter and sweet.</p>
                    <p>I’m breaking, I’m shaking, but she holds the key,</p>
                    <p>The only escape is when she sets me free.</p>

                    <h2>Bridge</h2>
                    <p>She twists the knife while she watches me bleed,</p>
                    <p>Feeding her hunger, the chaos she needs.</p>
                    <p>But the moment she tires, the moment she’s done,</p>
                    <p>She drops the strings, and I come undone.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus End</h2>
                    <p>Oh, how she moved, how she played,</p>
                    <p>Turned my nights into poisonous days.  </p>
                    <p>Her smile was a dagger, her touch was a chain, </p>
                    <p>Now I walk in her shadow, bound to the pain.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When she laughed, it was the sound of defeat,</p>
                    <p>Her power still lingers, dark and discreet.</p>
                    <p>She broke me, she shaped me, but I hold the key,</p>
                    <p>The scars will remind me, but now I’m finally free.</p>
