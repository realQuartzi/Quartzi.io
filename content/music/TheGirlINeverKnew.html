                    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                    <p>He was a boy, so tender, so shy,</p>
                    <p>Dreamed of the stars, reached for the sky.</p>
                    <p>Then she appeared, a name on a screen,</p>
                    <p>A face he had pictured but never had seen.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Her words were soft, her laughter was sweet,</p>
                    <p>She made his heart skip every beat.</p>
                    <p>Innocent chats turned into the night,</p>
                    <p>Two souls were dancing in digital light.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus 1</h2>
                    <p>Oh, he fell for a girl he had never met,</p>
                    <p>Lost in her voice, no room for regret.</p>
                    <p>But love's a fire, it burns or it heals,</p>
                    <p>And not every love is as true as it feels.</p>

                    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                    <p>They met at last, the world stood still,</p>
                    <p>Time seemed to stop, against their will.</p>
                    <p>Her touch was warm, her smile was bright,</p>
                    <p>The boy believed in love at first sight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But cracks appeared, a shadow, a shade,</p>
                    <p>Her kindness a mask that slowly decayed.</p>
                    <p>She read his words, accused him of lies,</p>
                    <p>Her anger was fire, her love a disguise.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus 1</h2>
                    <p>Oh, he fell for a girl he had never met,</p>
                    <p>Lost in her voice, no room for regret.</p>
                    <p>But love's a fire, it burns or it heals,</p>
                    <p>And not every love is as true as it feels.</p>

                    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
                    <p>Her fists would fly, her voice would roar,</p>
                    <p>But he stayed silent, would not go to war.</p>
                    <p>He bore the pain, the bruises, the shame,</p>
                    <p>Blinded by love, he carried the blame.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The whispers grew louder, the truth came clear,</p>
                    <p>Friends pulled him close, said, "She’s not sincere."</p>
                    <p>And though his heart cracked under the weight,</p>
                    <p>He found the strength to walk from his fate.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus 2</h2>
                    <p>Oh, he fell for a girl he had never met,</p>
                    <p>But love turned bitter, he paid the debt.</p>
                    <p>Love’s a fire, it burns or it heals,</p>
                    <p>And not every love is as true as it feels.</p>

                    <h2>Verse 4 (Ending)</h2>
                    <p>She begged, she cried, she schemed, she lied,,</p>
                    <p>But he’d seen the truth, no longer denied.</p>
                    <p>His heart was shattered, the pieces askew,</p>
                    <p>But he knew at last what he had to do.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>He let her go, though it tore him apart,</p>
                    <p>A lesson in love, a scar on his heart.</p>
                    <p>For sometimes the ones we think we adore,</p>
                    <p>Are the ones we must leave to find something more.</p>
