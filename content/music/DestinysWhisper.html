                    <h1>Part 1: Her Story</h1>
                    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                    <p>I met him on a rainy day,</p>
                    <p>His smile chased all the clouds away.</p>
                    <p>He held my heart, but didn’t know,</p>
                    <p>He makes me feel like I was home.</p>

                    <h2>Pre Chorus 1</h2>
                    <p>Every moment felt so bright,</p>
                    <p>He turned my darkness into light.</p>
                    <p>But the wind carried him away,</p>
                    <p>And he left without a word to say.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus (Her)</h2>
                    <p>Why does destiny let us meet, </p>
                    <p>When we’re bound to face defeat?</p>
                    <p>He was my calm, my gentle sea,</p>
                    <p>But now he's just a memory.</p>

                    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                    <p>I wait where we once used to stand,</p>
                    <p>Traced his touch, on my hand.</p>
                    <p>He gave me care I’d never known</p>
                    <p>Then vanished... now I'm all alone.</p>

                    <h2>Outro (Her)</h2>
                    <p>Did he want to stay, but couldn’t fight?</p>
                    <p>Was it fate that stole him from my sight?</p>
                    <p>I’ll never know why he walked away,</p>
                    <p>But I whisper his name every day.</p>

                    <h1>Part 2: His Story</h1>
                    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
                    <p>She laughed like the world was hers,</p>
                    <p>Her voice, the sweetest song I’ve heard.</p>
                    <p>We painted skies with dreams so high,</p>
                    <p>I never thought we’d say goodbye.</p>

                    <h2>Pre Chorus 2</h2>
                    <p>We walked through forests, chasing streams,</p>
                    <p>Her love was brighter than my dreams.</p>
                    <p>But whispers told her I’m too good</p>
                    <p>And she let go, thought I was no good.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus (Him)</h2>
                    <p>Why does destiny let us meet,</p>
                    <p>When we’re bound to face defeat?</p>
                    <p>She was my fire, my gentle flame,</p>
                    <p>But now she’s just a friend I claim.</p>

                    <h2>Verse 4</h2>
                    <p>I see her face in every crowd,</p>
                    <p>Her laughter echoes, far too loud.</p>
                    <p>They told her lies, she believed their song,</p>
                    <p>And now I’m left where I don’t belong.</p>

                    <h2>Outro (Him)</h2>
                    <p>Did she want to stay, but couldn’t fight?</p>
                    <p>Did they steal her heart and blur her sight?</p>
                    <p>I’ll never know why she turned away,</p>
                    <p>But I whisper her name every day.</p>

                    <h1>Part 3: Both</h1>
                    <h2>Bridge</h2>
                    <p><i>(Her)</i> I never told him how I cared.</p>
                    <p><i>(Him)</i> I wish I’d shown her I was scared.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>(Together)</i></p>
                    <p>Two hearts aligned, a perfect tune,</p>
                    <p>But torn apart by fate too soon.</p>

                    <h2>Chorus (Together)</h2>
                    <p>Why does destiny let us meet,</p>
                    <p>When we’re bound to face defeat?</p>
                    <p>A love so pure, it felt divine,</p>
                    <p>But it wasn’t ours, it’s not our time.</p>

                    <h2>Outro (Together)</h2>
                    <p>And so, we’re left to dream alone,</p>
                    <p>Two strangers lost, forever unknown.</p>
