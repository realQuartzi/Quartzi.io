                    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                    <p>Monday morning, rushing down the hall</p>
                    <p>Trying to blend in, pushing through it all</p>
                    <p>Never thought that I would catch your eye</p>
                    <p>As you walked past, made my heart reply</p>

                    <h2>Pre Chorus 1</h2>
                    <p>But something changed that autumn day</p>
                    <p>When you stopped and looked my way</p>

                    <h2>Chorus 1</h2>
                    <p>Now I'm a stranger in the mirror</p>
                    <p>Everything's a little clearer</p>
                    <p>Can't recognize who I've become</p>
                    <p>Since you made me come undone</p>
                    <p>Dancing through these new emotions</p>
                    <p>Drowning in this wild commotion</p>
                    <p>Tell me why I can't stay away</p>
                    <p>When I know I shouldn't play</p>

                    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                    <p>Friends keep saying that I'm not the same</p>
                    <p>Started dressing up, forgot my game</p>
                    <p>Used to know exactly who to be</p>
                    <p>Now your presence sets my chaos free</p>

                    <h2>Pre Chorus 2</h2>
                    <p>Every day I try to fight this change</p>
                    <p>But my heart won't rearrange</p>

                    <h2>Chorus 1</h2>
                    <p>Now I'm a stranger in the mirror</p>
                    <p>Everything's a little clearer</p>
                    <p>Can't recognize who I've become</p>
                    <p>Since you made me come undone</p>
                    <p>Dancing through these new emotions</p>
                    <p>Drowning in this wild commotion</p>
                    <p>Tell me why I can't stay away</p>
                    <p>When I know I shouldn't play</p>

                    <h2>Verse 3</h2>
                    <p>Maybe I should walk away</p>
                    <p>Before I lose myself completely</p>
                    <p>But every time I try to leave</p>
                    <p>Your smile pulls me back so sweetly</p>
                    <p>Oh, what have you done to me?</p>

                    <h2>Chorus 1 (End)</h2>
                    <p>Now I'm a stranger in the mirror</p>
                    <p>Everything's a little clearer</p>
                    <p>Can't recognize who I've become</p>
                    <p>Since you made me come undone</p>
                    <p>Dancing through these new emotions</p>
                    <p>Drowning in this wild commotion</p>
                    <p>Tell me why I can't stay away</p>
                    <p>When I know I should</p>
                    <p>When I know I should</p>
                    <p>When I know I should...</p>
