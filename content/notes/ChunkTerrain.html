                <h1>Ways to Optimize Chunk Generation</h1>
                <p>Proposed Game Engine: Unity</p>
                <p>
                    This is a pretty old piece I wrote. I figured out a lot of better information, specifically related to unity by now.
                    This was all still prior to Burst and Jobs. If only I thought about pooling chunks back then >.<

                    <h2>1. Noise Generation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Noise is the first thing that comes into play if forming terrain is in play, and therefore this should
                        also be the first point that can be optimized. Noise is not only used for the terrain generation but
                        could also be used for determining: Biomes, Zones, Environment Patches (Trees, Grass), etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many different ways Noise can be generated so determining the fastest and most Byte
                        efficient way can be really efficient but potentially not have the best results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only just the Generation of the Noise itself could be optimized but potentially how the Noise
                        values are collected and used.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are different ways this could be done:</p>
                    <li>Sampling a float [Range(0,1)] for every sample that is needed.</li>
                    <li>Sample an 2D or 3D array of values for Chunks in 1 go.
                        <ul>
                            <li>float[,] 2D Array of Floats</li>
                            <li>float[,,] 3D Array of Floats</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Having different methods for Noise collection for different attributes of the procedural world
                        could also be of some use. Fast Noise Sampling could be used for the Chunk Generation and
                        Slower but more efficient for Biome / Zone determination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Noise values are mostly determined between 0 and 1, floats instead of doubles should be
                        considered as float only have a size of 4 bytes while double are 8 bytes.

                    <h2>2. Vertex Tweaking</h2>
                    <p>For 3D terrain, more so Voxel / Block Terrain this is very important.</p>
                    <p>
                        You could render out each voxel which would result in: 8 vertices per block, 6 Faces and 12 Edges.
                        And if you were to render a Triangulated Block it would result in: 8 vertices, 12 Faces and 18
                        Edges. This as you can see is more information that is collected in each Voxel and if for example
                        not any UV data is require then perhaps Triangulated Meshes will not be required, saving some
                        information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only that way can memory be saved but also if you have an array of 16x16 Blocks, only the
                        necessary Faces that are shown on the outside / are visible to the eye and therefore only those
                        faces would have to be established and rendered saving a lot of vertices / computing power.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Coroutines</h2>
                    <p>Coroutines are a very useful asset for larger Chunk Generations.</p>
                    <p>
                        Using Coroutines will allow Chunks to be Generated separately from each other, which means
                        that instead of loading in all chunks during the same frame, they can be split and be generated
                        one after another. This can save a lot of Computer processing power. Not only can we now
                        control the fact that chunks are able to load one by one now, but as well we can control precisely
                        when we want chunks to load as since we are able to delay the generation of other chunks by x
                        amount of time.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>An example way of using Coroutines would be:</p>
                    <li>Creating a List of Chunks that are required to be loaded</li>
                    <li>Add a Boolean that tells us if a chunk is being loaded in</li>
<pre class="code-block language-csharp"><code>// Variables
List<Chunks> toLoadChunks = new List<Chunks>();
boolean loadingChunk = false;

// Load Chunk Call
if(!loadingChunk)
    StartCoroutine(LoadNewChunk());

// Load Chunk Coroutine
IEnumerator LoadNewChunk()
{
    loadingChunk = true;
    if(toLoadChunks.Count > 0)
    {
        //Load First Chunk In List
        toLoadChunks.RemoveAt(0);
    }
    loadingChunk = false;

    yield return null;
}

                    <p>
                        Taking into account that the Mesh index buffer data will be kept at 16 bits we are able to support
                        65535 vertices in a single mesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then adding on top of that, we will take into account that we have already been adjusting the
                        Vertexes with our Tweak techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the prerequisites we can remove all chunks with a width of 64 to be over the limit even with
                        our tweaks, leaving us with the 2 other width options but multiple height options
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If it came to optimization it would be best to limit the amount of chunks that are required to be
                        spawned and therefore separate the height value from the width to create a taller chunk. This
                        also helps with saving these chunks as not as many data files have to be made and edited at any
                        given time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Getting the right Chunk Size is harder then expected as we are taking many (not all) possibilities
                        into account of what this could effect, so I believe it is best to name all the ones that we are facing
                        at this time.

                    <h3>Are Chunks Editable?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Mesh Data size will determine if we will be able to load in the chunk faster or slower. To
                        clarify what is meant with Mesh Data Size, it is all the information that is stored in the mesh and
                        which has to be evaluated and developed during the creation of the mesh, which can contain, the
                        Mesh Vertex Data, Vertex Color, UV Data and other things. For the most efficient scenario having
                        smaller chunks will make this step faster.                        
                    </p>

                    <h3>Mesh Load / Unload Times</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is highly determined on the system that will have to execute this. Loading smaller Chunks is
                        faster then loading bigger chunks, but if we are loading smaller chunks this means that we will be
                        loading more chunks as well dependent on our render distance. The difference between a chunk
                        of 16 size and 32 size can be estimated to take 8 the difference in time.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>But how are we going to load in the Chunks?</p>
                    <p>
                        There are 2 main ways of doing it.
                        First way would be to Instantiate an Empty GameObject and feed all the values to it.
                        The second and more efficient way is, Creating a GameObject from scratch and feeding all the
                        information to it then.    
                    </p>
<pre class="code-block language-csharp"><code>// Established Object for this Chunk
GameObject chunkObj;

// Components Required
MeshRenderer meshRenderer;
MeshFilter meshFilter;

// Chunk Data
List<Vector3> vertices = new List<Vector3>(); // 12 Bytes per Input

                    <p>
                        Shown above allows us to create a Chunk without instantiating an GameObject to edit which
                        saves a lot of processing power.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unloading on the other hand we only really have 2 methods available to us: Destroy and
                        SetActive(false). If we are not going to reuse the Chunk then Destroying it is the way to go. 
                        But the question is still how will we unload a Chunk?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best way to unload a chunk is to destroy it without losing its data. So the Chunk when created
                        will be added to a list of Chunks. So when we need to recreate the Chunk we can grab it from the
                        List and then rebuild it. Now if we where to keep adding Chunks to the list we would get a
                        memory overload, therefore when you reach a specific distance away from the chunk it will then
                        as well be removed from this List.

                    <h2>Future Note</h2>
                    <p>A lot of the information here is pretty decent to read. But the majority of it is nonsense that you
                        do not need to worry about. If you can get to the point where you are able to create and load in chunks and unload 
                        the ones you do not need (frustum culling) you are on a good path. Make sure you reuse chunks that are currently not being rendered. 
                        There is no reason to ever Destroy a chunk. Just reuse the object and save yourself the destroy and instantiate... they cost a lot.  
                        And don't get to greedy when you first begin. If you have some working generation look into greedy meshing, it will do wonders.
