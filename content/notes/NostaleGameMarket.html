                <h1>Short Analysis of In-Game Market Development in Nostale</h1>
                <p>A very old analysis about how the same game can develop different market values.</p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Understanding how in-game markets develop is an intriguing topic, especially in MMORPGs where player-driven economies shape the value of items. 
                        This document explores how the community influences the in-game market in Nostale, particularly focusing on the Vendetta Nostale private server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this analysis is simplified compared to larger games like World of Warcraft, it provides insight into how items gain value based on player activity, 
                        supply and demand, and external influences such as real-money transactions.

                    <h2>Factors Influencing Item Values</h2>
                    <p>Several factors contribute to the fluctuating values of in-game items:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Game Age & Item Rarity:</b> New items often experience heavy price fluctuations until the market stabilizes.</li>
                        <li><b>Time & Effort to Obtain the Item:</b> Items requiring extensive farming or difficult content tend to hold higher value.</li>
                        <li><b>Item Importance & Utility:</b> Items that significantly impact gameplay (e.g., equipment, consumables) generally maintain stable or rising prices.</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>Three Main Pricing Paths in the Market</h2>
                    <p>From observations, the community tends to determine item values through three primary methods:</p>
                    <h3>1. Initial Pricing & Natural Adjustment</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first price is often set arbitrarily by a player and then adjusts over time based on supply and demand. As more players buy and sell, 
                        the item's price stabilizes to a reasonable market value.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Real-Money Exchange Influence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Items available in an online store for real-money transactions typically take their value based on in-game currency conversion rates. For example:
                    </p>
                    <li>If a $99 pack of 1000 coins is valued at 24,000 gold per coin, an item costing 199 coins in the store would be approximately:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>199 Ã— 24,000 = 4,776,000 gold (4.776kk)</b></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Players may adjust the price slightly based on desired profit margins, typically rounding up (e.g., selling for 5kk).</li>
                    <li>However, comparing in-game currency to real money is controversial and often avoided.</li>
                    <h3>3. Private Server Price Disparities</h3>
                    <p>
                        In private servers, pricing often follows unconventional trends due to customized rates and drop modifications. 
                        This can lead to unusual pricing models that do not always align with logical market behavior.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Case Study: Vendetta Nostale Private Server</h2>
                    <p>To analyse the price differences between the official Nostale server and the Vendetta Nostale private server, we must first acknowledge key differences:</p>
                    <li><b>Gold Rate:</b> Set to 4x (based on in-game observations, though the forums mention 5x).</li>
                    <li><b>Drop Rates:</b> Custom, varying per item.</li>
                    <li><b>Best-Case Scenario Consideration:</b> Some items drop in multiples (e.g., boots and gloves can drop four at a time), amplifying market supply.</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Using these adjustments, let's compare item prices:</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The in-game market of Nostale, particularly on private servers like Vendetta Nostale, is heavily influenced by:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Gold and drop rate modifications:</b> Higher drop rates lead to increased supply, often reducing prices.</li>
                        <li><b>Item utility and desirability:</b> Items essential for progression maintain higher values.</li>
                        <li><b>External influences from real-money transactions:</b> In-game store purchases create a direct conversion metric for pricing.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, private servers demonstrate unique market behaviours that may not always align with traditional supply-demand logic,
                        resulting in interesting economic trends within the player-driven marketplace.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Additional Consideration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Even though the private server provides 4x the amount of gold, the market does not simply adjust to 4x the original value. 
                        This is especially evident when examining items obtained through real-money transactions, which tend to be increasingly inflated in value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under normal circumstances, easier acquisition of these items should lead to lower prices, but the reality is more complex. 
                        Many players are hesitant to engage in real-money transactions on unofficial servers due to trust concerns. 
                        This creates a scarcity effect for these items, increasing their value disproportionately compared to standard in-game items. 
                        The interplay between easier acquisition, market trust, and external transaction risks results in a distinct pricing structure compared to official servers.
